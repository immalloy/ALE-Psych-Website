Use these pages to build content without editing the engine source. Start with menu and substate scripting, then add songs and custom events as needed.

## Recommended Path

1. Create or override menus and substates to shape your user experience.
2. Add songs with the required folder layout for charts, audio, and scripts.
3. Extend behavior with custom classes or event scripts.
4. Package configuration and options so players can tune the mod.

Each linked page includes file paths and examples tailored to ALE Psych mods.
